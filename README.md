# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

This project provides an end-to-end analysis and segmentation of customer purchasing behavior using the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data, which includes details on sales transactions from a UK-based online retail store, has been processed and clustered to identify customer groups based on
- Spending habits
- Purchase frequency
- Recency of transactions

Key insights and actionable strategies are derived for each customer segment to enhance business decision-making. 
The dataset used is sourced from [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).
